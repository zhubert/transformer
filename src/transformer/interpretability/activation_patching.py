Activation Patching for Causal Analysis

Tools for performing causal interventions on transformer activations to identify
which components are responsible for specific model behaviors.

What is Activation Patching?
-----------------------------
Activation patching is a technique for testing **causal hypotheses** about which
parts of a neural network are responsible for specific behaviors. Instead of just
observing what the model does, we actively intervene and measure the effect.

The Core Idea:
--------------
1. Run the model on two inputs:
   - **Clean run**: The model produces the correct/desired behavior
   - **Corrupted run**: The model produces incorrect/different behavior

2. For each component (layer, head, position), we "patch" by:
   - Taking activations from the clean run
   - Inserting them into the corrupted run
   - Measuring how much this restores the correct behavior

3. Components that restore correct behavior are **causally important** for that task.

Example Use Case:
-----------------
Question: "Which layers are crucial for predicting 'Paris' after 'The Eiffel Tower is in'?"

Setup:
- Clean input: "The Eiffel Tower is in" → Model predicts "Paris" ✓
- Corrupted input: "The Empire State Building is in" → Model predicts "New York" ✗

For each layer:
- Patch layer activations from clean → corrupted
- Measure: Does it now predict "Paris"?
- If yes → This layer is causally important for the Eiffel Tower → Paris mapping!

Types of Patching:
------------------
1. **Residual Stream Patching**: Patch the full residual stream at a layer
2. **Position-Specific Patching**: Patch only specific token positions
3. **Layer Scanning**: Test all layers to find most important ones

Metrics:
--------
- **Recovery Rate**: What % of the correct behavior is restored?
  - 100% = Full recovery (predicts like clean)
  - 0% = No recovery (still predicts like corrupted)
  - >100% = Overcorrection (even better than clean)
