Training Utilities: Gradient Accumulation for Stable Training

This module implements gradient accumulation, a technique that allows us to simulate
large batch sizes without running out of memory. This is essential for training
transformers effectively on hobby-scale hardware.

================================================================================
THE PROBLEM: Small Batches Lead to Noisy Training
================================================================================

When training neural networks, we compute gradients (which direction to update weights)
by averaging the loss across multiple training examples. This averaging is crucial:

    With 1 example: Gradients are very noisy (each example is different)
    With 8 examples: Gradients are less noisy (8 examples average out)
    With 1000 examples: Gradients are smooth and reliable

But there's a catch: Processing more examples requires more memory!

**Current situation (without gradient accumulation):**
    Batch size: 8 sequences × 128 tokens = 1,024 tokens
    Problem: Small batch → Noisy gradients → Unstable training
    GPU/MPS memory: 8GB available, 4GB used
    Can't increase batch_size to 128 without running out of memory!

**The memory bottleneck:**
    - Forward pass stores activations for backward pass
    - Larger batches = more activations = more memory
    - M1 Mac has ~8GB unified memory total
    - Can't just make batch_size bigger!

================================================================================
THE SOLUTION: Gradient Accumulation
================================================================================

The key insight: We don't need to process all examples simultaneously!

Instead of one big batch, we can:
1. Process 16 small batches of 8 sequences each
2. Accumulate (sum) the gradients from each batch
3. Update weights once after all 16 batches
4. Result: Equivalent to batch_size=128, but only 8 in memory at once!

**Gradient accumulation in action:**

    Normal Training (batch_size=8):
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ Batch 1 (8 sequences)               │
    │   Forward → Loss → Backward         │
    │   Update weights ← Gradients        │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
    Result: Weights updated using 8 examples (noisy!)

    With Accumulation (accumulation_steps=16, batch_size=8):
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ Batch 1 (8 sequences)               │
    │   Forward → Loss → Backward         │
    │   Store gradients (don't update yet)│
    ├─────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ Batch 2 (8 sequences)               │
    │   Forward → Loss → Backward         │
    │   Add to accumulated gradients      │
    ├─────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ ... (repeat for batches 3-16)       │
    ├─────────────────────────────────────┤
    │ Batch 16 (8 sequences)              │
    │   Forward → Loss → Backward         │
    │   Add to accumulated gradients      │
    │   Update weights ← Average gradients│
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
    Result: Weights updated using 128 examples (smooth!)

**Memory usage:**
    Only one small batch in memory at a time!
    Peak memory: Same as batch_size=8
    Effective batch: batch_size × accumulation_steps = 8 × 16 = 128

**Cost:**
    Compute: ~0% overhead (same number of forward/backward passes)
    Time: Exactly the same (we still process same number of examples)
    Benefit: Much more stable training!

================================================================================
THE MATHEMATICS: Why This Works
================================================================================

What we want (large batch, but can't fit in memory):
    gradient = ∇L(B₁ + B₂ + ... + B₁₆)    # Loss over combined batch
    gradient = (∇L(B₁) + ∇L(B₂) + ... + ∇L(B₁₆)) / 16

What we do (accumulation):
    accumulated_grad = 0
    for each batch Bᵢ:
        accumulated_grad += ∇L(Bᵢ)
    final_grad = accumulated_grad / 16

These are mathematically equivalent! Gradients are linear, so:
    ∇(L₁ + L₂) = ∇L₁ + ∇L₂

The division by accumulation_steps gives us the average, just like a large batch.

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
================================================================================

PyTorch makes this surprisingly simple:

    Normal training:
        optimizer.zero_grad()          # Clear old gradients
        loss.backward()                # Compute gradients
        optimizer.step()               # Update weights

    With accumulation:
        optimizer.zero_grad()          # Clear old gradients (once per accumulation cycle)

        for i in range(accumulation_steps):
            loss = compute_loss(batch[i])
            loss = loss / accumulation_steps   # Scale loss (important!)
            loss.backward()                    # Accumulate gradients

        optimizer.step()               # Update weights (once per accumulation cycle)

**Why scale the loss?**
    PyTorch accumulates gradients by default (gradients add up).
    Without scaling: gradient = ∇L₁ + ∇L₂ + ... + ∇L₁₆ (too large!)
    With scaling: gradient = (∇L₁ + ∇L₂ + ... + ∇L₁₆) / 16 (correct average)

================================================================================
EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

Before (batch_size=8, no accumulation):
    Epoch 1:  Loss bounces: 8.2 → 7.9 → 8.1 → 7.8 → 8.0 (very noisy)
    Epoch 5:  Loss: 4.2 → 4.1 → 4.3 → 4.0 → 4.2 (still noisy)
    Final loss: ~2.5-2.7 (decent but unstable)

After (batch_size=8, accumulation_steps=16, effective_batch=128):
    Epoch 1:  Loss smooth: 8.2 → 8.0 → 7.8 → 7.6 → 7.4 (steady decline)
    Epoch 5:  Loss: 4.0 → 3.9 → 3.8 → 3.7 → 3.6 (very smooth)
    Final loss: ~2.0-2.2 (better and stable!)

**Benefits:**
    ✓ 20-30% lower final loss
    ✓ Smoother training curves (easier to debug)
    ✓ More reliable gradient updates
    ✓ Faster convergence (fewer wasted updates)
    ✓ Better generalization (less overfitting)

**When to use:**
    - Always! Unless you can already fit massive batches in memory
    - Especially important for small-batch training (< 32 examples)
    - Critical for transformer training (they benefit from large batches)

**Recommended values:**
    - Small models: accumulation_steps=16 (effective_batch ~128-256)
    - Medium models: accumulation_steps=32 (effective_batch ~256-512)
    - Large models: accumulation_steps=64+ (effective_batch ~512-1024+)

            loss = compute_loss(outputs, targets)

            # Backward pass with accumulation
            should_update = accumulator.backward(loss, optimizer)

            # Update weights when accumulation is complete
